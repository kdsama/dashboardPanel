# dashboardPanel
I didnt know how to deal with the messages, were they supposed to be Socket.IO thing ? 
For that I would have needed a front end as well . Also I have uploaded the backend because I didn't know how to do it using Angular Js ,
as asked in the assignment . 
I also had to look up for the way for how to use JWT tokens for authentication  . 
I used mongoose , so I got little bit confused as before I used mongoDB npm and it has several CRUD methods .
